Command-Line Interface
----------------------

The main command-line interface to Rau is the command ``rau``, which is
automatically installed as part of the ``rau`` package. It has sub-commands for
two tasks: language modeling (``lm``) and sequence-to-sequence transduction
(``ss``). Each task has sub-commands that correspond to three pipeline stages:

1. take pre-tokenized plaintext data and prepare it in a way that makes it more
   efficient to load later
2. take prepared data and train a new model on it from scratch
3. use a trained model to process some prepared data

For language modeling, the sub-commands are

* ``rau lm prepare``
* ``rau lm train``
* ``rau lm evaluate`` (compute cross-entropy and perplexity)
* ``rau lm generate`` (randomly sample sequences)

For sequence-to-sequence transduction, the sub-commands are

* ``rau ss prepare``
* ``rau ss train``
* ``rau ss translate`` (translate input sequences to output sequences)

For details on how to use these commands, run them with ``-h`` to see their help
messages or see the examples in :doc:`getting-started`.

Features and Limitations
------------------------

This section lists some of Rau's features and known limitations. This
side-by-side comparison of Rau's pros and cons may help you decide if Rau is a
good fit for your needs.

Features
^^^^^^^^

#. The dataset format is deliberately simple: plaintext consisting of one
   sequence per line, where each sequence consists of whitespace-separated
   tokens.
#. It is not tied to a particular tokenization algorithm, because it does not
   implement tokenization at all. It is compatible with datasets preprocessed by
   external tokenization tools, such as SentencePiece.
#. Offers different ways of handling UNK tokens. You can declare a particular
   token, such as ``<unk>``, to represent a catch-all UNK token. Or, you can
   disable UNK tokens entirely and treat out-of-vocabulary tokens as errors.
#. Implements a separate data preparation step that makes loading data more
   efficient, saving work across multiple experiments. This includes figuring
   out the set of tokens to use in the vocabulary, converting tokens to
   integers, and saving the data in a binary format.
#. Everything is efficiently vectorized and supports both CPU and GPU modes.
#. Rau is very fast for small model sizes and small dataset sizes, even on CPU.
   An example of a "small" language modeling experiment would be a model with
   about 128k parameters and a dataset of about 100k sequences up to length 40.
   Rau can train hundreds of small models to convergence in under 20 minutes on
   a scientific computing cluster using only CPU nodesâ€”no GPUs! This is very
   useful for researchers who train neural networks on small, synthetic
   experiments.
#. Accepts random seeds in many places to allow for deterministic results
   (unfortunately, this does not apply to dropout).
#. Although the only tasks implemented are language modeling and
   sequence-to-sequence transduction, it is possible to define new tasks while
   reusing the same training loop logic by extending the class
   :py:class:`~rau.tasks.common.TrainingLoop`.
#. Provides a flexible Python API for building neural network architectures by
   composing simpler ones. In particular, it provides an abstract base class
   called :py:class:`~rau.unidirectional.Unidirectional` that represents a
   unidirectional sequential neural network, which makes it effortless to modify
   or compose sequential neural network architectures. The
   :py:class:`~rau.unidirectional.Unidirectional` class supports both
   timestep-parallel training and autoregressive decoding. If you have two
   :py:class:`~rau.unidirectional.Unidirectional` models that support both of
   these modes, you can compose them into a model that feeds the outputs of the
   first model as inputs to the second, and the composite model will also
   support both modes efficiently, for free. See
   :doc:`composable-neural-networks`.
#. Related to the above, composed sequential neural networks support lazy output
   evaluation. If, for example, you add an output embedding layer to a
   transformer or RNN language model and prompt it with a sequence of input
   tokens before generating a continuation, Rau is smart enough to know that it
   does not need to compute any output logits corresponding to any positions in
   the prompt except for the last position. This is important because computing
   output logits can be a very expensive operation for large vocabulary sizes.
   This applies to any pointwise :py:class:`~rau.unidirectional.Unidirectional`
   that does not maintain state across timesteps, such as layer norm, dropout,
   feedforward layers, etc. In fact, Rau uses a flexible and general API that
   allows for arbitrary lazy evaluation logic, such as depending on only the
   previous :math:`k` outputs of the previous layer.
#. None of the architectures have upper limits on sequence length. This includes
   the transformer, which uses sinusoidal positional encodings that can be
   extended arbitrarily. You can train on short sequences and evaluate on
   arbitrarily long sequences.
#. A tensor of sinusoidal positional encodings is cached throughout the whole
   program for efficiency.
#. All language models and decoders operate exclusively on whole sequences
   ending in EOS, without truncation, and without assigning any probability to
   tokens that cannot be generated, namely padding and BOS. This means that,
   mathematically, Rau's language models always define tight language models,
   i.e., probability distributions over the set of all strings of tokens.
   Training examples are never truncated, split across multiple minibatches, or
   shifted to different positions. This is in contrast to other setups that
   treat the training data as one long sequence and split it into chunks of
   fixed size.
#. In the transformer encoder-decoder model, the encoder is always given an EOS
   symbol at the end of the input so that it can more easily locate the end of
   the sequence.
#. The RNN and LSTM use learned initial hidden states.
#. PyTorch misguidedely uses two bias terms in the recurrent layers of the RNN
   and LSTM. Only one is required; the second one is redundant and serves only
   to double the learning rate of the bias term at the cost of adding additional
   parameters to the model. This means that RNNs and LSTMs can have speciously
   high parameter counts, which is undesirable if you are trying to match
   different architectures based on parameter count. Rau takes care to remove
   these redundant bias parameters, resulting in better parameter counts.
#. Implements tied token embeddings.
#. Efficiently precomputes and caches sinusoidal positional encodings in the
   transformer.
#. Parameters can be optimized using either simple gradient descent or Adam.
   This can be configured with ``--optimizer``.
#. Supports minibatching with padding. For the sake of efficiency, Rau groups
   sequences of similar length together to reduce the number of padding tokens,
   and it enforces upper limits on the number of tokens in a minibatch to avoid
   running out of memory.
#. Padding is handled correctly, in the sense that there is mathematically no
   difference between processing :math:`N` sequences in a single minibatch with
   padding and processing the same `N` sequences individually while accumulating
   their gradients. Rau's unit tests confirm this. Minibatching is simply an
   implementation detail that increases throughput.
#. Padding tokens do not take up space in the vocabulary or in the embedding
   matrix of the model. That is, there is no integer ID in the vocabulary that
   is devoted to padding. Instead, Rau dynamically figures out integer IDs to
   use for padding that don't conflict with other tokens. They are an
   implementation detail that is entirely hidden from the user. Language models
   and decoders never assign probability to padding tokens and are unaware that
   padding tokens exist.
#. Able to train models to convergence or cap training to a maximum number of
   epochs. Uses performance on a validation set to control the learning rate
   schedule and early stopping. Checkpoints are taken at regular intervals
   during training based on the number of training examples seen; the frequency
   can be controlled with ``--examples-per-checkpoint``. The learning rate
   starts at an initial value set by ``--initial-learning-rate`` and decreases
   every time validation performance does not improve after a certain number of
   checkpoints, which is set by ``--learning-rate-patience``. The learning rate
   is decreased by multiplying it by a value in :math:`(0, 1)`, which can be
   configured with ``--learning-rate-decay-factor``. Training stops early if
   validation performance does not improve after some number of checkpoints,
   which is controlled by ``--early-stopping-patience``. The maximum number of
   epochs is set with ``--max-epochs``.
#. Implements optional gradient clipping.
#. Makes it easy to a save model and its metadata in a directory and load it
   again later. Also implements a machine-readable log format that records data
   from the training process for later analysis. When training ends, the
   parameters of the best checkpoint have been saved to disk.
#. Provides an implementation of beam search. Beam search is parallelized across
   beam elements (but not minibatch elements).
#. Implements length normalization in beam search.
#. The beam search implementation stores and follows backpointers efficiently,
   in parallel and without costly copy operations.
#. Beam search terminates as soon as EOS is the top beam element, rather than
   waiting for the beam to fill up with EOS. This is correct because the a beam
   element can never have a descendant with higher probability than itself. The
   latter approach is only required if the scores can increase, e.g., when using
   certain kinds of length normalization.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. It is not as battle-tested as well-known libraries like Hugging Face, and it
   cannot be used at scale to pre-train large language models.
#. The only tasks implemented are language modeling and sequence-to-sequence
   generation.
#. The only architectures available for language modeling are the simple RNN,
   LSTM, and transformer.
#. The only architecture available for sequence-to-sequence generation is the
   transformer encoder-decoder.
#. Ancestral sampling and beam search are the only available sampling algorithms
   for now.
#. Ancestral sampling is not parallelized across minibatch elements.
#. Beam search is not parallelized across minibatch elements.
#. Due to limitations in the API for PyTorch's transformer implementation,
   decoding for transformers is very inefficient. At every step of decoding, all
   of the hidden representations are re-computed from scratch, and the model
   generates outputs for all previous timesteps, even though only the most
   recent one is needed. It does not implement what is commonly called "KV
   caching." The only things that are cached are the input embeddings. This
   might be fixed in the future.
#. It does not include tokenization and detokenization in the pipeline. You need
   to handle tokenization and detokenization yourself.
#. It slurps the entire training set into memory during training, so it will run
   out of memory on large datasets (~1m sequences). This might be fixed in the
   future.
#. It only implements one kind of learning rate schedule. Learning rate warmup
   is not included (although it is not badly needed for transformers with
   pre-norm).
#. Training cannot be stopped and restarted, so it cannot recover from crashes.
   This feature might be added in the future.
#. Does not implement distributed training or inference across multiple devices
   or machines, so it cannot be used for very large models.
