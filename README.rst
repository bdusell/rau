Rau
===

Rau (rhymes with "now") is a Python module and command-line tool that provides
PyTorch implementations of neural network-based language modeling and
sequence-to-sequence generation. It is primarily suited for academic
researchers. Out of the box, it provides implementations of the simple
recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer
architectures. It includes extensible Python APIs and command-line tools for
data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. It is very easy to get started
with the command-line tools if you provide your data in plaintext as lines of
space-separated tokens.
